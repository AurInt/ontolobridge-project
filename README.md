# OntoloBridge

 “OntoloBridge,” is the bridge between the user gap and controlled scientific vocabularies.
 Ontologies are sets of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that show their 
 properties and the relations between them. The OntoloBridge system will provide a semi-
 automated, convenient, rigorous process for researchers around the world to update and 
 extend the BioAssay Ontology. The approach will be general and extensible to other ontologies, APIs and tools.
